# Who am I?

If you've stumbled upon this page, then hello.  
  
My name is Jack. At the time of writing this "biography", I am 22 years old
and about to start my final year of university studying Computer Science.  

My mom likes to ask me, "Why do you want to stare at a screen for the rest of your life?"  
  
Sometimes I ask myself the same thing. But then I remember, the power to be able to build something from a keyboard and terminal is like magic at your fingertips. The possibilities are quite limitless. I hope you feel the same way, and if not, I hope through this blog I will be able to convince you.  

So have fun reading, hopefully I'm not too much of a bore.  

Best,  
Jack
